# Restaurant Revenue Prediction

This project predicts the annual sales of new restaurant locations for Tab Food Investments (TFI), the company behind brands like Burger King, Sbarro, Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arbyâ€™s.

## Project Overview

Opening new restaurants is costly and risky, especially when site selection relies on subjective judgment. Poor location choices often lead to closures within 18 months.  

This project builds a machine learning model that uses demographic, real estate, and commercial data to predict restaurant sales. The goal is to help TFI make smarter investments and reduce failed openings.  

The notebook covers:
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Sales prediction
